    Prior to this fix VAX MP would refuse to enable multiprocessing
    via CPU MULTI <n> command in the described configuration.

3.8.3 (1)

    Properly enumerate host CPUs on multi-socket host machine under Linux.
    Prior to this fix, SMT factor was incorrectly calculated on such a machine,
    and if hyperthreading was enabled, VAX MP would refuse to run in SMP mode.

    Fix Ethernet bootstrap (>>> B XQ).
    Prior to this fix, VAX MP would not boot over Ethernet due to
    "unexpected system operation" abort in SSC clock code.
